# CPQ in SaaS: Challenges, Pain Points, and Opportunities

## Introduction 
Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) software is meant to streamline how businesses configure products, set pricing, and generate quotes for customers. In the SaaS industry – where offerings often include tiered subscriptions, usage-based charges, add-on modules, and frequent pricing changes – an effective CPQ process is critical for efficiency and revenue growth. In theory, a CPQ tool should reduce manual errors, speed up sales cycles, and simplify the quote-to-cash journey ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=A%20CPQ%20tool%20enhances%20the,predictable%20and%20sustainable%20revenue%20growth)) ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=3,quoting%20speed)). In practice, however, many organizations find existing CPQ solutions *difficult to implement, frustrating to use, and only partially effective* in meeting their needs. This report takes a deep dive into the CPQ ecosystem with an emphasis on business and user experience perspectives, analyzing why CPQ remains a challenging problem. We examine the major pain points in current solutions, compare established vendors to newer innovators, and identify what the market demands from a “better” CPQ, especially for SaaS companies with complex pricing models.

## The CPQ Ecosystem: Established vs. Emerging Solutions 
Multiple software vendors offer CPQ tools, ranging from legacy enterprise platforms to newer startups focused on modern SaaS needs. Below is an overview of key players and how they stack up:

- **Salesforce CPQ (SteelBrick)** – A popular choice, especially for SaaS firms already using Salesforce CRM. It supports subscription products, renewals, and advanced pricing features within the Salesforce environment. Salesforce CPQ offers robust capabilities, but many users report that *it can be overwhelming, expensive, and complex without significant training* ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=While%20it%20is%20a%20powerful,too%20complicated%20for%20young%20startups)) ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=While%20it%20is%20a%20powerful,too%20complicated%20for%20young%20startups)). After Salesforce acquired SteelBrick, some customers noted **performance issues at scale** (long page load or calculation times for large quotes) and bugs in new releases that impacted usability ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=We%20implemented%20Steelbrick%20in%202015,wait%20times%20for%20the%20user)) ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=platform%20limits%20or%20long%20wait,times%20for%20the%20user)). It’s delivered as a managed package on the Salesforce platform rather than fully native, which has led some developers to describe it as “really slow and clunky” with a poor user experience ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=CPQ%20as%20domain%20is%20really,com%20%2Fplatform%2Fcpq)). 

- **Oracle CPQ (BigMachines)** – A standalone CPQ solution known for its power in handling extremely complex product configurations (originating in manufacturing use cases). Oracle CPQ is highly customizable and scalable for large enterprises, with strong integration options (especially into Oracle’s ecosystem) ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=Image%3A%20oracle%20cpq%20screenshot)) ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=Integration%20capabilities%3A)). However, it comes with **significant complexity in setup and configuration**, often requiring expert consulting. Oracle CPQ also entails a high total cost of ownership; even a standard implementation can *cost in the six figures*, which can rise to $1M+ for very large catalogs and customizations ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20implementing%20a%20CPQ%20solution,to%20get%20up%20and%20running)). In short, it’s reliable for those who need its depth, but smaller SaaS firms find it **too heavy and costly** for their needs ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=Cons%3A)).

- **Conga CPQ (Apttus)** – A CPQ solution that runs on the Salesforce platform (separate from Salesforce’s own CPQ). Conga (formerly Apttus) emphasizes flexibility, complex pricing and product configuration, and tight linkage to contract lifecycle management. Users often praise its rich features, but also warn of a **steep learning curve** during the initial setup ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=Cons%3A)). Administrators and developers who have worked with Apttus CPQ have candidly described it as *“slow and **[difficult]** to use,”* echoing similar complaints as Salesforce CPQ ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=CPQ%20as%20domain%20is%20really,com%20%2Fplatform%2Fcpq)) ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)). Significant upfront customization is usually needed, so time-to-value can be long. The end-user interface and experience for sales reps has historically been a pain point, requiring training for effective use ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=Cons%3A)) ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=Cons%3A)).

- **SAP CPQ** – Part of SAP’s Sales Cloud, this CPQ integrates with SAP’s ERP and CRM systems. It is geared toward enterprises (including SaaS companies that already run SAP for billing or finance). SAP CPQ can handle complex pricing logic and is often used when a direct connection to SAP back-end data (like pricing conditions or inventory) is needed. However, outside of SAP-centric shops its adoption in the SaaS sector is limited. Similar to others, it requires substantial configuration; businesses not already on SAP may find integration **challenging and resource-intensive** (common with any CPQ hooking into multiple systems). *User experience feedback* on SAP CPQ is less publicly discussed, but it likely mirrors other legacy solutions in needing expert setup and offering a utilitarian UI.

- **Industry-Specific CPQ (e.g. CloudSense)** – Niche CPQ players target specific industries. For example, CloudSense offers a CPQ tailored for telecom, media, and communications services. It runs on Salesforce and is praised for handling industry-specific bundling and pricing requirements ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=CloudSense%20offers%20a%20CPQ%20solution,cash%20process)). CloudSense can be adapted to SaaS use cases and is noted for a more user-friendly interface than some legacy tools ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=Pros%3A)). Yet, its *industry focus* means SaaS companies might require extra configuration to use it ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=,Powerful%20automation%20features)), and its community is smaller than the big-name vendors ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=Cons%3A)). Notably, some large telecom CPQ projects with CloudSense have taken **years to deliver** ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=It%20seems%20that%20everyone%20hates,they%27re%20taking%20years%20to%20deliver)), underscoring that even a specialized tool doesn’t eliminate CPQ complexity.

- **Newer CPQ Innovators** – In response to the pain points above, a wave of startups and modern CPQ solutions has emerged, aiming to simplify and modernize the quote process for SaaS. Examples include **Subskribe**, **Salesbricks**, **Cacheflow**, **Logik.io**, and others. These tools emphasize things like: no-code configuration of pricing rules, support for usage-based models, lightning-fast user interfaces, and built-in integrations across the quote-to-cash cycle. For instance, Subskribe (a recent entrant focused on enterprise SaaS) touts that it avoids the traditional *“nightmare of SKU explosion”* and rigidity of older CPQs, enabling far more pricing flexibility without custom coding ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=The%20landscape%20of%20enterprise%20SaaS,while%20enabling%20unprecedented%20pricing%20freedom)). It supports complex models (tiered, block pricing, percent-of-use, prepaid credits, etc.) out-of-the-box ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=No%20Limits%20on%20Pricing%20Models,handle%20it%20without%20custom%20development)) ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=No%20Limits%20on%20Pricing%20Models,handle%20it%20without%20custom%20development)). Startups like these also stress **unified platforms** – Subskribe provides a single catalog for quotes through billing, so companies don’t have to maintain separate product and pricing data in different systems ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=Unified%20Quote,and%20manual%20reconciliation%20between%20systems)) ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=Unified%20Quote,and%20manual%20reconciliation%20between%20systems)). Another innovator, Logik.io, focuses on improving the configuration engine and even leverages AI to help administrators write product rules in plain English, tackling a traditionally complicated task with generative AI assistance ([Logik.io Launches Industry-First AI Capabilities for CPQ and Commerce](https://www.logik.io/news/logik-launches-industry-first-ai#:~:text=Logik,AI%20to%20create%20advanced%20rules)) ([Logik.io Launches Industry-First AI Capabilities for CPQ and Commerce](https://www.logik.io/news/logik-launches-industry-first-ai#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAt%20Logik,io)). While these new solutions are promising and align closely with SaaS needs, they are still proving themselves. They generally have *fewer real-world deployments* than the established vendors, and some very specific features of old systems (e.g. complex engineering part configurations, or deep regional discount hierarchies) may not all be present initially. Still, they highlight the direction of the market and attempt to directly address the shortcomings of the previous generation.

To summarize how the platforms compare, the table below highlights a few of the established CPQ solutions versus newer approaches, along with their strengths and common pain points:

## Major Challenges and Pain Points in CPQ 
Despite the promise of CPQ tools, businesses and users have consistently encountered a set of recurring challenges. These pain points explain why configuring and quoting remains, in many organizations, an unsolved or only partially solved problem. Below, we break down the key issues from both business and user experience perspectives:

### Complexity of Implementation and Maintenance 
Nearly all full-featured CPQ systems are **difficult to implement**. By nature, they must handle myriad product rules, pricing conditions, approvals, and exceptions – which means *setup is intricate*. Companies often underestimate this complexity. As one seasoned expert bluntly put it, *“CPQ tools are some of THE MOST COMPLEX tools around. It is often impossible for anyone who is not experienced in it to configure them.”* ([No one is happy after implementing CPQ (except the consulting company and CPQ company itself) : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/7vcc4p/no_one_is_happy_after_implementing_cpq_except_the/#:~:text=,products%20for%20no%20real%20reason)). Initial deployments commonly require months of work and specialized expertise. It’s not unusual for a CPQ project to take **6+ months** just to reach a usable state ([CPQ vs. Quote-to-Cash](https://www.getcacheflow.com/post/cpq-vs-quote-to-cash#:~:text=,struggle%20to%20handle%20rapidly%20growing)), and costs can exceed **$100,000** for even a relatively standard implementation ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20implementing%20a%20CPQ%20solution,to%20get%20up%20and%20running)). Larger firms with thousands of product configurations might spend well into seven figures on a CPQ rollout ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=And%20that%20price%20can%20drastically,of%20%241%20million%20or%20more)). 

This complexity isn’t a one-time event; **maintenance is an ongoing burden**. Products, pricing, and sales strategies evolve continuously (especially in SaaS). Each change may require reconfiguring the CPQ rules or data. If the tool was heavily customized by consultants, the company may need to retain CPQ specialists or train in-house admins to manage it day-to-day ([No one is happy after implementing CPQ (except the consulting company and CPQ company itself) : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/7vcc4p/no_one_is_happy_after_implementing_cpq_except_the/#:~:text=,don%27t%20need%20a%20CPQ%20tool)). One Reddit user lamented that after implementation, *“you need to have in-house people who know the tool inside out”* to reconfigure products as they change ([No one is happy after implementing CPQ (except the consulting company and CPQ company itself) : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/7vcc4p/no_one_is_happy_after_implementing_cpq_except_the/#:~:text=You%20have%20to%20realise%20that,products%20when%20they%20start%20changing)). Without dedicated resources, the system quickly becomes outdated or full of errors. All of this adds up to **high total cost of ownership** – not only the software licenses, but also ongoing admin time and consulting fees. A VP of Business Operations famously cautioned that a CPQ might promise savings or more revenue, *“but what’s the price for actually doing it? … If you’re saving $700k a year but spending $300k on implementation fees and $100k on maintenance, is it worth it?”* ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=As%20Tom%20Murtaugh%2C%20Senior%20VP,services%2C%20is%20it%20worth%20it%3F%E2%80%9D)).

**Upgrades and updates** present another headache. Many CPQ tools (like Salesforce CPQ) deliver regular updates or tie into platform releases. Users have reported that new releases sometimes *broke existing functionality* or introduced bugs, forcing emergency rework. For example, after Salesforce acquired SteelBrick, customers *“routinely found releases to be completely unusable due to software issues,”* with previously fixed bugs reappearing ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=platform%20limits%20or%20long%20wait,times%20for%20the%20user)). One admin described a surprise change that suddenly caused quote processing timeouts, saying *“we were like WTF just happened – it was SteelBrick pushing some update without informing us.”* ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=)) Such scenarios require reactive maintenance and erode confidence. In sum, the complexity and effort to **keep a CPQ system running smoothly** is a top complaint at the business level.

### Painful User Experience for Sales Teams 
From the perspective of end-users (sales reps, sales ops, channel partners), many CPQ solutions have a reputation for **poor usability**. Common frustrations include slow performance, unintuitive interfaces, and too many steps to accomplish simple quoting tasks. In theory, CPQ should *speed* the quoting process, but if the tool is clunky, it can have the opposite effect initially. There are reports of sales teams resisting adoption of a new CPQ because it’s easier to fall back to Excel or legacy methods than to navigate a cumbersome system. In fact, a well-known refrain is that *“everyone hates their CPQ product.”* Across various enterprises and industries, users often express dissatisfaction, and it’s not uncommon to hear that “no one seems happy” with the CPQ they implemented ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)).

Specific UX issues mentioned by users include: pages that take a long time to load or calculate when a quote has many line items, complicated forms with dozens of fields or checkboxes, and difficulty making adjustments on the fly. For instance, some features in Salesforce CPQ “do not scale well” – if a rep builds a large quote, they might hit system limits or face long wait times to recalculate prices ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=and%20when%20things%20work%20it,wait%20times%20for%20the%20user)). In other cases, the navigation through configuring a deal can involve jumping between multiple screens (product selection, then pricing, then approvals, etc.), which feels disjointed. One frustrated user summed up Apttus and SteelBrick experiences by calling them *“really slow and clunky, and [with] **[poor]** user experience”* ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=CPQ%20as%20domain%20is%20really,com%20%2Fplatform%2Fcpq)). This kind of feedback indicates not just minor annoyances, but a fundamental gap between what users expect (fast, easy quoting) and what they encounter.

Another aspect of UX is **training and intuitiveness**. A CPQ that isn’t straightforward means new sales hires or anyone not deeply trained will struggle. If reps cannot easily find the right product configuration or if they constantly make mistakes due to confusing options, the tool creates friction. Some companies have tried to mitigate this by heavily customizing the CPQ interface or adding guided selling prompts. Others, as noted, resort to external tools: for example, one solution vendor even offers an Excel add-in as an alternate UI for Salesforce CPQ, acknowledging that some users find working in spreadsheets more natural than Salesforce’s web screens ([Elevate Salesforce CPQ for complex quoting - Valorx](https://valorx.com/resources/blog/simplify-salesforce-cpq-complex-quoting/#:~:text=Elevate%20Salesforce%20CPQ%20for%20complex,by%20providing%20an%20Excel%20connector)). The need for such workarounds underscores that **user-centric design** has been lacking in many traditional CPQ systems. 

Ultimately, if using the CPQ is too much of a hassle, salespeople will look for shortcuts or bypasses – entering “dummy” quotes just to draft a proposal, or managing pricing in separate spreadsheets and only uploading the final numbers to the CPQ for record-keeping. These workarounds defeat the purpose of having an integrated system and can reintroduce errors and inefficiencies. Thus, a *critical unsolved issue* is making CPQ tools truly easy and even enjoyable for the sales teams to use on a daily basis ([CPQ Software for SaaS Businesses: How to Choose the Right One](https://vendori.com/blog/cpq-software-for-saas-businesses-how-to-choose-the-right-one#:~:text=,Actually%20Likes%20Using%20It)). This is where newer products are trying to differentiate, by prioritizing UX (e.g. drag-and-drop configurators, real-time price updates, one-click quote generation, etc.) ([CPQ Software for SaaS Businesses: How to Choose the Right One](https://vendori.com/blog/cpq-software-for-saas-businesses-how-to-choose-the-right-one#:~:text=A%20CPQ%20that%E2%80%99s%20clunky%20will,Features%20to%20look%20for)).

### Fragmented Quote-to-Cash Process and Integration Gaps 
A CPQ does not operate in a vacuum – it sits in the middle of the broader **quote-to-cash (QTC) process**, which spans from initial quote creation to signing the contract, fulfilling the order, billing the customer, and recognizing revenue. If the CPQ isn’t well integrated into this flow, companies face serious inefficiencies and errors. One major pain point for businesses has been the **lack of seamless integration** between CPQ systems and other software like CRM, billing systems, ERP, and eSignature/contract tools.

In an ideal world, the moment a quote is finalized in the CPQ, it should feed directly into contract generation (with all the correct terms and pricing), then flow into an order or subscription system for provisioning, and into a billing system to invoice the customer. In reality, many companies have *silos*. For example, the sales team might quote a custom SaaS deal using CPQ, but then the finance team has to manually re-enter or adjust the pricing in the subscription billing platform (like Zuora, Chargebee, Stripe, etc.) to actually bill it. This manual intervention is not only time-consuming, but prone to mistakes. If the **product catalogs differ** between systems, the situation is even worse – the CPQ might have SKUs or price points that don’t exactly match what the billing system expects. The result can be pricing discrepancies that require finance to reconcile and fix after the fact ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20if%20quotes%20generated,in%20wasted%20time%20and%20resources)) ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20if%20quotes%20generated,in%20wasted%20time%20and%20resources)). Subskribe’s analysis notes that when quotes don’t reflect data in billing, finance inevitably spends time doing manual reconciliation to true-up invoices, wasting time and resources ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20if%20quotes%20generated,in%20wasted%20time%20and%20resources)).

Even integration between CPQ and CRM (where opportunities and quotes are tracked) can be challenging if they’re not from the same vendor. A standalone CPQ has to be connected via APIs so that customer and deal information flows in and quote data flows out. These integrations are **not always plug-and-play**. Companies often have to build custom connectors or use middleware, which adds to the project scope ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=Custom%20integrations)) ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=a%20manual%20and%20time,a%20variety%20of%20custom%20integrations)). As business processes change, the integrations have to be updated, leading to a fragile setup if not managed carefully. An expert commentary described it well: different QTC systems are *“not always interoperable… they can’t connect seamlessly… [without] custom integrations,”* and this means sales reps end up switching between tools or doing manual data imports, which is *“time-consuming”* and error-prone ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=Custom%20integrations)) ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=When%20there%20is%20a%20lack,a%20variety%20of%20custom%20integrations)).

For SaaS companies, **subscription management** is a key part of quote-to-cash that often isn’t fully covered by a traditional CPQ. Many CPQ tools originated in an era of one-off product sales (like selling a piece of equipment) rather than recurring subscriptions. So while they can quote a subscription price, they might not handle changes over time well (e.g. upgrades/downgrades, renewals, or co-terming multiple subscriptions in one contract). Oftentimes, a separate Subscription Billing system is used for that, which means the CPQ must hand off data to that system. If that hand-off is imperfect, renewals can get messy – sales might quote something to a customer for a renewal or expansion, but ensuring that aligns with their existing entitlements and that billing will correctly invoice it can be difficult without tight integration.

**Contracting and approvals** form another link in the chain. If CPQ isn’t integrated with a contract lifecycle management (CLM) tool, the quote might be exported to Word/PDF and manually turned into a contract, which introduces a chance that what gets signed isn’t exactly what was quoted. Many CPQ vendors (like Conga, Salesforce, Oracle) offer add-on modules or partnerships for CLM and e-signature to try to address this. Even so, users complain about approval workflow bottlenecks – e.g. a discount needs manager approval, but if that approval doesn’t feed back into the system, it slows the deal. The ideal is an automated workflow where, say, a quote with too high a discount automatically routes for approval and once approved, the quote is unlocked for the rep to send out. Some companies have not fully implemented this, meaning they rely on email or Slack to get approvals, slowing the quote-to-contract cycle ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=sales%20process,give%20you%20back%20valuable%20time)) ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=Manual%20sales%20processes%20often%20lead,doesn%E2%80%99t%20slow%20down%20the%20deal)).

In summary, **fragmentation in the QTC process** is a pain point that current CPQ solutions only partially solve. The tools exist to connect CPQ to CRM, billing, and contracts, but integration projects are costly and often fragile. The market clearly demands a smoother end-to-end flow (or unified platforms) because broken links in quote-to-cash lead to lost revenue, delays, and endless internal friction between Sales, Finance, and Ops. As one source put it, companies need CPQ to *“play nice with your tech stack”* – integrating with CRM, billing/payments, ERP, and support systems – so that quotes turn into cash without manual intervention ([CPQ Software for SaaS Businesses: How to Choose the Right One](https://vendori.com/blog/cpq-software-for-saas-businesses-how-to-choose-the-right-one#:~:text=,with%20Your%20Tech%20Stack)).

### Rigidness vs. SaaS Pricing Complexity 
SaaS businesses frequently experiment with their pricing and packaging. They might introduce new pricing models (for example, moving from pure subscription to a hybrid subscription + usage model), offer tailored bundles to enterprise clients, or run promotional discounts. A recurring complaint is that many CPQ solutions are **too rigid to accommodate these changes easily**. Traditional CPQ systems were often built around catalog structures that assume relatively static SKUs and predefined options. When faced with usage-based pricing, tiered volume discounts, or per-customer custom plans, these systems struggle. Businesses end up using awkward workarounds, like creating dozens of one-off SKUs to represent different tiers or scenarios – leading to the infamous *“SKU explosion”* problem ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=The%20landscape%20of%20enterprise%20SaaS,while%20enabling%20unprecedented%20pricing%20freedom)). Having hundreds or thousands of SKUs clutters the product catalog and makes ongoing management a nightmare. It also slows down the quoting process (as reps have to pick from too many similar options) and increases the chance of error (selecting the wrong SKU).

Another example of rigidity is how CPQ handles **multi-year SaaS deals or ramp deals**. A ramp deal (where the price or quantity increases over the contract term) is common in enterprise SaaS. Some CPQ tools do support this (Salesforce CPQ has “Multi-dimensional quoting” for instance), but users have found it “imperfect” or confusing to use ([Salesforce CPQ Optimization: 4 Challenges to Overcome](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-cpq-optimization-challenges-to-overcome/#:~:text=Salesforce%20CPQ%20Optimization%3A%204%20Challenges,Dimensional%20Quoting%20%28MDQ%29%20%C2%B7%203)). Others that lack built-in support require the sales rep to create separate line items for each year, or separate quotes, which is cumbersome. If a SaaS company wants to offer a custom usage-based overage charge, a rigid CPQ might not calculate it, so reps might resort to manually calculating usage fees outside the system and then entering a lump sum, losing traceability of how that price was derived.

Because of these limitations, **pricing agility** is hampered. SaaS product teams may be hesitant to modify pricing or launch new packages if the CPQ system will take weeks or months of reconfiguration to catch up. As one SaaS-focused vendor observed, business models are evolving rapidly but *“most CPQ solutions remain stubbornly rigid”* in the face of that ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=The%20landscape%20of%20enterprise%20SaaS,while%20enabling%20unprecedented%20pricing%20freedom)). This gap between what the business wants to do and what the tool easily supports is a major reason CPQ is not delivering full value. It remains *partially solved* in that CPQ can handle basic subscription pricing well, but when you push beyond that (e.g. mixing one-time fees, recurring fees, usage fees, and discounts all in one quote), many tools crack under the complexity or require heavy scripting.

The **implications** of this rigidity are significant: sales teams might have to delay giving quotes for new offerings until the system is updated (slowing time-to-market), or they might issue quotes outside the system (losing control and consistency). It also leads to friction between Sales and Finance. If Finance wants to enforce pricing policies (say, ensure usage is always charged at a certain rate), but the CPQ can’t formulaically do it, they have to trust sales to calculate it correctly or verify every quote manually. One blog noted that maintaining multiple pricing engines (one in CPQ, one in billing) makes it hard to keep data consistent, and sales reps might not have the latest pricing info at hand, leading to inconsistent or incorrect quotes ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=particularly%20for%20complex%20products%20with,becomes%20an%20even%20greater%20challenge)) ([The Biggest Challenges and Pitfalls of Traditional CPQ Solutions | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/the-biggest-challenges-and-pitfalls-of-traditional-cpq-solutions#:~:text=Product%20offerings%20and%20pricing%20models,and%20duplicated%20effort%20and%20costs)). The *lack of a single source of truth* for pricing is both a tech and process shortcoming.

### Inefficiencies and Frustrations in Daily Use 
Apart from the broad categories above, it’s worth noting the **day-to-day inefficiencies** that users cite, which make CPQ feel like an unsolved problem. Sales operations leaders often talk about *deal velocity* – how fast can a quote get out the door and turn into a closed deal. When CPQ systems are slow or convoluted, they can slow down deal cycles instead of accelerating them. For instance, if generating a quote takes a rep several hours of back-and-forth with the system (and maybe waiting for an approval), that’s time not spent on selling. One of the classic pain points pre-CPQ was *slow quote turnaround*, and CPQ was supposed to fix that; however, if the implementation is poor, reps can still take days to get a quote out, due to internal process bottlenecks ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=3,quoting%20speed)). Fast-growing SaaS companies, in particular, demand high velocity – they can’t afford a tool that makes them *less* agile in sales.

Additionally, consider **error rates** and “garbage in, garbage out” issues. A CPQ is configured with business rules to prevent errors (like incompatible product options or over-discounting). But if those rules are incomplete or if users find ways to bypass them, errors can still occur. And when mistakes happen (wrong price, missing line item, etc.), the quote often has to be reworked, involving more cycles and sometimes management intervention to approve corrections. This creates frustration and a perception that the CPQ process is bureaucratic. As a result, some sales orgs report that their teams “hate Salesforce after this” – referring to a CPQ rollout – because it’s seen as an impediment rather than a helpful tool ([No one is happy after implementing CPQ (except the consulting company and CPQ company itself) : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/7vcc4p/no_one_is_happy_after_implementing_cpq_except_the/#:~:text=1,manage%2Fmaintain)). In one candid forum post, a user listed their CPQ outcomes as: “big pain to manage/maintain, users are not happy at all, and management is asking why this is so hard given the money and time spent” ([No one is happy after implementing CPQ (except the consulting company and CPQ company itself) : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/7vcc4p/no_one_is_happy_after_implementing_cpq_except_the/#:~:text=1,manage%2Fmaintain)). That encapsulates the trifecta of pain: admins are stressed, end-users are annoyed, and executives are disappointed.

Finally, **CPQ project failures** are not unheard of. It’s an open secret in the industry that a significant percentage of CPQ implementation projects stall out or go over-budget. Some companies abandon a CPQ initiative after realizing it’s more than they bargained for, or they cut down the scope drastically to only use a fraction of the features (essentially ending up with a glorified pricing spreadsheet in the guise of CPQ). Others have had to redo their CPQ approach – for example, switching from one vendor to another or even reverting to a custom-built solution when a packaged one didn’t fit. Each of these scenarios reinforces the notion that CPQ, especially for complex SaaS pricing, *remains a hard problem to solve*. It’s telling that some mid-sized SaaS businesses choose to build an internal CPQ tool from scratch (as one Reddit user did for 5 years) rather than implement a commercial product ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=CPQ%20users%20out%20there%2C%20what,are%20you%20happy%20with%20it)). They do this because they feel the available solutions will not meet their unique needs without imposing complexity. However, maintaining a homegrown CPQ has its own long-term pains (talent dependency, keeping up with platform changes, etc. as noted above), which is why even those companies eventually go looking for a better off-the-shelf solution ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=Reply%20%20reply)) ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=CPQ%20is%20a%20challenging%20concept,will%20also%20say%20a%20lot)).

## What the Market Demands from CPQ (Unmet Needs)
Given the challenges outlined, it’s clear that the market is hungry for improvements. Businesses and users are essentially asking for a CPQ that **truly fulfills its promise** – without the downsides. Key capabilities and qualities in demand (and often not fully met by current solutions) include:

- **Ease of Use and Adoption:** A top priority is **better user experience**. Modern sales teams expect software that is as easy as consumer apps. This means a clean, intuitive UI for configuring quotes, minimal clicks to get things done, and responsive performance. Features like drag-and-drop quote building, real-time price calculations as you configure, and one-click proposal generation can make a huge difference. If a CPQ is *easy and pleasant to use*, sales reps will actually embrace it (whereas historically, many CPQ tools saw low adoption or grudging use). The demand is for CPQ interfaces designed with sales workflow in mind, not just IT logic. As one guide put it, the CPQ should be so straightforward that *“your sales team actually likes using it”* ([CPQ Software for SaaS Businesses: How to Choose the Right One](https://vendori.com/blog/cpq-software-for-saas-businesses-how-to-choose-the-right-one#:~:text=,Actually%20Likes%20Using%20It)) – otherwise it will be bypassed. This area remains ripe for innovation, as legacy vendors only slowly improve UI, while startups are explicitly focusing on UX as a selling point.

- **Agility in Supporting Pricing/Packaging Changes:** Companies want the ability to *quickly update or create new pricing models* without months of reconfiguration. This calls for **flexible, no-code or low-code administration**. A pricing manager should be able to introduce a new subscription tier or a promotional discount rule through a user-friendly admin interface, ideally without writing scripts or requiring developer time. The market is asking for CPQ engines that handle a wide array of SaaS pricing structures natively – from flat subscriptions to usage-based billing, from tiered volume discounts to one-time setup fees – all in one system ([CPQ Software for SaaS Businesses: How to Choose the Right One](https://vendori.com/blog/cpq-software-for-saas-businesses-how-to-choose-the-right-one#:~:text=,Handle%20Your%20Pricing%20Complexity)). If something novel comes up (say, a new “pay-as-you-go with committed discount” plan), the CPQ should be adaptable enough to accommodate it with configuration, not a code customization. This agility also applies to product configuration rules: businesses want to *tailor offerings on the fly*, so the CPQ must allow adding or bundling products dynamically. In short, **configurability** (without coding) is a key unmet need that new solutions are targeting, using techniques like dynamic rule engines and templates.

- **Faster Deal Cycles (Velocity):** Sales leaders and CEOs care about metrics like quote turnaround time and conversion rates. A CPQ system should accelerate these by automating manual tasks and providing intelligent guidance. The market expects features such as: automated approval workflows (to eliminate email chains for discount approvals), guided selling prompts (so reps know which add-ons or upgrades to include, boosting cross-sell), and even AI-driven recommendations. For example, an intelligent CPQ might suggest an optimal package for a customer based on their usage or industry, or flag if a quote’s discount is outside typical bounds. These things can shorten the negotiation cycle and improve win rates. If current CPQs only offer static rule enforcement, businesses now want more *smarts* in the process. We’re seeing early moves here – e.g. some vendors adding AI assistants for quote configuration and rules creation ([Logik.io Launches Industry-First AI Capabilities for CPQ and Commerce](https://www.logik.io/news/logik-launches-industry-first-ai#:~:text=Logik,AI%20to%20create%20advanced%20rules)) – but there’s ample room to grow. Ultimately, companies demand that CPQ contribute to **faster quote-to-cash** timelines, not slow them down. Any inefficiency (like re-entering data, waiting days for approvals, etc.) is viewed as something to eliminate.

- **End-to-End Integration (Unified Quote-to-Cash):** Perhaps the loudest call from the market is for better integration across the entire revenue operations toolchain. Businesses are looking for either a single platform that covers CPQ *and* billing *and* contract management, *or* for out-of-the-box connectors that genuinely require minimal effort to deploy. The goal is **one source of truth for product and pricing data** across sales and finance ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=Unified%20Quote,and%20manual%20reconciliation%20between%20systems)). This could manifest as a unified catalog that feeds both the CPQ and the billing system, so that a price change or new product addition is automatically reflected everywhere (as some newer solutions promise ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=Unified%20Quote,and%20manual%20reconciliation%20between%20systems))). It also includes integration of quoting with CRM (so quotes link to opportunities seamlessly) and with e-signature/CLM tools (so you can generate a contract or order form from the quote with one click). Essentially, the market wants to collapse the traditional boundaries between CPQ, billing, and revenue management. SaaS CFOs and RevOps leaders talk about **quote-to-revenue** as a continuum – from the quote all the way to revenue recognition in accounting. Any breaks in this continuum cause revenue leakage or delays ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=A%20CPQ%20tool%20enhances%20the,predictable%20and%20sustainable%20revenue%20growth)) ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=1,inaccuracies)). So a CPQ that either comes bundled with or easily connects to subscription management, invoicing, and revenue recognition is highly attractive. For example, Subskribe’s pitch directly addresses this by including CPQ, billing, and revenue recognition in one system so that there are “no multiple catalogs” and no integrations to build ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=Unified%20Quote,and%20manual%20reconciliation%20between%20systems)) ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=Automated%20Revenue%20Recognition%20%E2%80%8DBuilt,sales%20the%20flexibility%20they%20need)). While not every company will adopt an all-in-one, the expectation is that modern CPQ at least **works in concert** with the rest of the stack from day one.

- **Scalability and Performance:** As SaaS companies grow, their CPQ needs to scale in multiple dimensions: number of users (sales teams expanding), number of products/SKUs, and complexity of deals. The market demands that adding more products or complexity *should not result in exponential slowdowns* or system crashes. This is a reaction to past incidents where, for example, a quote with 500 line items would make a system grind to a halt. Enterprises want assurance that a CPQ can handle large quotes (5,000+ line items, or very large configurator trees) with acceptable performance ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=,manage%20changes%20to%20existing%20subscriptions)). They also want support for global operations – multi-currency, multi-language, various regional pricing rules – without needing separate instances. Essentially, CPQ should be enterprise-grade in robustness, but without sacrificing speed. Many current solutions have known limits (Salesforce CPQ, for instance, can hit Salesforce governor limits if abused). Addressing this is both a technical and architectural need (e.g. using more efficient calculation engines, maybe cloud scaling, or asynchronous processing that doesn’t block the user). Emerging “headless” CPQ engines and those using modern cloud infrastructure are steps in this direction.

- **Lower Total Cost and Faster ROI:** Given the historical cost of CPQ projects, there’s a strong desire for solutions that can be deployed faster and maintained with less effort (and cost). Mid-market SaaS companies, in particular, seek CPQ tools that fit their size and don’t require a six-figure budget to get started. This means clearer out-of-the-box functionality, perhaps industry-specific templates (so that a company doesn’t have to configure from scratch), and generally a **reduction in required professional services**. The notion of a “lean” or turnkey CPQ is appealing. Startups like Salesbricks position themselves as more suitable for young SaaS companies, claiming to avoid the overwhelming complexity and cost of big-name CPQs for a smaller organization ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=While%20it%20is%20a%20powerful,too%20complicated%20for%20young%20startups)). If the market finds a CPQ that can be rolled out in weeks instead of months, with configuration largely done by a business admin rather than a team of consultants, that would meet a huge unmet need. Essentially, *time-to-value* needs to improve. This includes easier learning curves – intuitive enough that sales ops or RevOps teams can self-serve on setup after a bit of training, rather than hiring outside experts for every tweak.

- **Omnichannel and Self-Service Capabilities:** Today’s B2B buyers increasingly expect the ability to explore and even configure purchases on their own (think of a customer portal or a self-service sign-up that can handle complex quoting). Traditional CPQ was solely a salesperson’s tool, hidden from the customer. The market now is interested in CPQ capabilities that can be exposed in e-commerce storefronts or partner portals. In other words, a robust API or headless CPQ that allows the same configuration logic to be used in a website for customers is valuable. This ties back to the point in Conga’s blog: if customers can’t “buy the way they want to buy” because your systems can’t support self-service without breaking the rules, you’re missing opportunities ([5 Sales Pain Points Solved by CPQ Automation | How CPQ Transforms Sales](https://conga.com/resources/blog/5-sales-pain-points-solved-by-cpq-automation#:~:text=4,way%20they%20want%20to%20buy)). Having an API-first CPQ that the IT team can embed into a custom UI or a chatbot or any channel is increasingly important. Some newer CPQs advertise themselves as headless or API-driven for this reason. The end goal is *omnichannel sales*: whether a deal comes through a sales rep, a reseller, or directly via an online signup, the same CPQ logic ensures consistency. Many existing solutions are catching up here, but not all have easy ways to extend beyond the core UI (some are tightly coupled to a Salesforce UI, for example). So this remains partially met and a point of differentiation.

- **Analytics and Optimization:** Finally, the market is starting to seek more insight from the CPQ process itself. Questions like: *Where are quotes getting stuck? How often are discounts above a certain threshold? What configurations are most popular or what options are rarely chosen?* Having analytics around these can help refine the product offerings and sales approach. Traditional CPQ tools typically did not offer robust analytics out-of-the-box – companies would export data to BI tools. Now, vendors like Subskribe mention *“built-in analytics and optimization tools”* to turn pricing into a strategic advantage ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=Strategic%20Revenue%20Intelligence%20%E2%80%8DTransform%20pricing,drive%20growth%20through%20intelligent%20pricing)) ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=For%20enterprise%20SaaS%20companies%2C%20the,organizations%20are%20seeing%20transformative%20results)). While perhaps not the top priority compared to getting the basic functionality right, this indicates an emerging demand: CPQ systems shouldn’t just be transactional; they should provide intelligence (e.g. showing the impact of a pricing change on win rates, or identifying that a certain bundle could be created based on frequent combinations). 

In summary, the market is demanding a **new generation of CPQ solutions** that overcome the legacy limitations. The wish-list centers on *simplicity, flexibility, integration,* and *speed*. Many of these needs are only partially met by current leading vendors, which is why we see innovation and new entrants trying to fill the gaps.

## How SaaS Companies Are Coping Today 
Considering the limitations of existing CPQ offerings, how are SaaS businesses managing their configure/price/quote process in practice? It’s a mixed landscape, and it often depends on the stage and complexity of the company:

- **Spreadsheets and Manual Processes (for Simplicity):** Some smaller SaaS startups or those with relatively straightforward pricing stick to the basics: they use spreadsheets or simple tools to prepare quotes. In the short term (few products, standard pricing), this can work. However, as soon as the pricing gets complex or the volume of quotes grows, manual methods show strain – errors creep in, version control of quotes becomes an issue, and the sales cycle slows down ([CPQ Software for SaaS Businesses: How to Choose the Right One](https://vendori.com/blog/cpq-software-for-saas-businesses-how-to-choose-the-right-one#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20running%20a%20SaaS,like%20what%E2%80%99s%20on%20your%20website)). Many firms realize they’re losing efficiency or even revenue (by misquoting) when relying on manual quoting beyond a point. This realization is often what pushes them to look into CPQ software in the first place.

- **CRM Add-Ons and Homegrown Solutions:** Companies using CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot sometimes start by using built-in quoting features or light add-ons. For example, Salesforce’s native quoting (not CPQ, but a simpler module) can handle basic product quotes and output a PDF. It’s not very flexible but is easy to use; some organizations extend it with custom scripts or approval processes to serve as a mini-CPQ. Others invest developer time to build an internal tool (like a custom app or an extension of their product catalog database) that handles configuration logic and pricing. In one case, a Salesforce developer built an internal CPQ from scratch that was used for five years internally ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=CPQ%20users%20out%20there%2C%20what,are%20you%20happy%20with%20it)). This route can be tailored exactly to the business’s needs and integrated with internal systems. The downside is maintenance: as mentioned, keeping a custom CPQ up-to-date with CRM changes or new requirements can become a “war of attrition” for the developers involved ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=turinturambar81)). Over time, the internal knowledge might fade (people leave), and the company might face a tough choice to either rebuild or finally implement a commercial tool. Nonetheless, this approach is a testament to the fact that many teams felt the available CPQs didn’t fit, so they rolled their own solution despite the effort involved.

- **Using CPQ with Limited Scope:** Many SaaS companies do buy a CPQ (like Salesforce CPQ, etc.) but then choose to implement it with a **narrow scope** initially. They might restrict it to handling core subscription quoting, but not use it for more complex cases until they’re comfortable. For instance, they may quote standard deals through CPQ, but any “special” deal (complex custom pricing) might still be handled manually by a sales operations specialist. Or they use CPQ for new sales but handle renewals through the billing system separately. This phased or limited use is a way to mitigate risk – essentially using CPQ where it fits best and avoiding pushing it into scenarios where it struggles. The drawback is that it requires clear policies (so reps know when to use the CPQ and when to escalate to a manual process) and it sacrifices some automation (since special cases aren’t automated). Over time, many try to expand CPQ usage to those edge cases as the tool or their understanding improves.

- **Multiple Tools and Data Reconciliation:** It’s not uncommon for mid-to-large SaaS firms to use a **combo of tools**: e.g. Salesforce CPQ for configuring the deal, DocuSign or Conga for generating the proposal/contract document, and then a billing platform like Zuora for invoicing and subscription tracking. They might also have a separate revenue recognition system. Each handoff between these is an integration point that has to be managed. Some organizations have invested in building a robust integration layer or use an iPaaS (integration platform) to sync data between these systems. Even so, operational teams often perform audits – checking that what was quoted matches what was billed, etc., indicating friction. The quote-to-cash process in these companies is sometimes held together by a lot of behind-the-scenes work (either by people or by custom code). In essence, they “cope” by filling in where the tools don’t directly connect. For example, finance might have a checklist to review big deals for any discrepancies. Or sales ops might maintain a “shadow” price book in a spreadsheet to do complex calculations that the CPQ can’t, then feed the results in. This isn’t ideal, but it’s part of reality in many organizations.

- **Iteration and Re-implementation:** Another pattern is that companies go through *multiple iterations* to get CPQ right. They might fail or struggle on the first attempt – perhaps choosing a tool that was too complex or implementing too fast without proper process alignment – and then regroup. Some switch vendors (for instance, moving from Conga CPQ to Salesforce CPQ or vice versa, or from a legacy on-prem CPQ to a newer cloud CPQ). Others stick with the same tool but completely overhaul the setup with the help of new consultants or an internal task force. One Salesforceben article noted several challenges like performance, multi-dimensional quoting, etc., and provided optimization tips ([Salesforce CPQ Optimization: 4 Challenges to Overcome](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-cpq-optimization-challenges-to-overcome/#:~:text=Salesforce%20CPQ%20Optimization%3A%204%20Challenges,Dimensional%20Quoting%20%28MDQ%29%20%C2%B7%203)), which implies that often the second phase of a CPQ project is optimization after learning the pitfalls. SaaS companies that have the resources will keep tuning the system – adding custom code here, optimizing product catalog there – to gradually improve it. However, less-resourced companies may simply live with a suboptimal CPQ if they can’t afford a do-over.

- **Adopting Emerging Solutions:** Forward-looking SaaS businesses (especially newer ones without legacy baggage) are starting to pilot the **next-gen CPQ tools**. For example, a high-growth SaaS that finds Salesforce CPQ too slow might try out a startup like Salesbricks or Subskribe early on. If those prove effective, it gives them an edge with a more nimble sales process. Of course, this is still a newer trend – the majority of the market is on the established tools or manual methods. But as the new entrants mature, we expect more SaaS companies to migrate to those in search of relief from the pain points. It’s a space to watch, as success stories from early adopters could rapidly shift the landscape.

In essence, **SaaS companies cope through a mix of stop-gap measures, partial tool use, and constant adaptation**. The quote-to-cash process is so vital that every organization finds *some* way to make it work, but often not in the most elegant or efficient way. There is widespread acknowledgement that current solutions leave something to be desired, which is why the door is open for innovation.

## Opportunities for Building a Better CPQ Solution 
The analysis above makes it evident that significant gaps exist between what current CPQ solutions deliver and what businesses really need. For anyone considering innovating in the CPQ space, these gaps represent opportunities. A “better” CPQ solution for the SaaS era could differentiate itself in the following ways, directly addressing the pain points:

- **User-Centric Design:** Prioritize a **modern UX** that delights sales reps. This means designing workflows that match how salespeople sell. A potential innovator could focus on single-page quote configuration (reducing page loads), inline edits that recalc prices in real-time, and visual configuration (e.g. showing the impact of different choices immediately). Even elements of gamification or feedback could help (for instance, showing the rep how a discount affects their commission or the deal margin in real time might guide behavior). The opportunity is to turn CPQ from a chore into an assistive selling tool. Given the chorus of complaints about current UIs, a product that demonstrably cuts quoting time with an intuitive interface would gain traction. Ensuring that **speed** is a feature of the UI (sub-second response, no annoying lag) would directly tackle one of the biggest user frustrations.

- **Rapid Implementation and Configuration:** There is a market for a CPQ that can be deployed in days or weeks, not months. This could be achieved by providing out-of-the-box templates for common SaaS pricing schemes. For example, pre-built templates for “monthly/annual subscription with tiered pricing” or “usage-based pricing with overage” could be included. A new CPQ solution could offer a library of best-practice configurations that a company can pick and tweak, rather than starting from scratch. Additionally, offering **guided setup wizards** for admins (perhaps even AI-driven configuration suggestions based on the company’s website pricing page or product catalog) would simplify the onboarding. Reducing reliance on custom scripts by offering a powerful rules engine that is also easy to use (as Subskribe’s and Logik.io’s approaches suggest ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=Zeppa%E2%84%A2%3A%20The%20Industry%27s%20Most%20Advanced,across%20your%20entire%20revenue%20lifecycle)) ([Logik.io Launches Industry-First AI Capabilities for CPQ and Commerce](https://www.logik.io/news/logik-launches-industry-first-ai#:~:text=Logik,AI%20to%20create%20advanced%20rules))) is key. The tagline here is *“configuration, not customization.”* If an innovator can say “no consultants required, your RevOps admin can set it up,” that’s a huge selling point in this space.

- **Flexible and Future-Proof Architecture:** To address the **pricing model rigidity**, a new CPQ should be built with flexibility at its core. This might mean a **modular product and pricing model** concept, where new types of charges can be added without code. For instance, if tomorrow a SaaS business wants to start charging based on API calls, the CPQ should allow creating a “metered API call fee” easily, whereas today that might be very hard in a legacy tool. Embracing a variety of pricing structures (one-time, recurring, usage, milestone-based, percentage-of-total, etc.) and allowing them to mix and match in one quote is a huge opportunity. The concept of avoiding SKU explosion (maybe through attributes and dynamic pricing logic instead of static SKUs) can be a differentiator ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=The%20landscape%20of%20enterprise%20SaaS,while%20enabling%20unprecedented%20pricing%20freedom)). Also, supporting **“grandfathering”** (managing customers on legacy pricing while new ones are on new pricing ([Beyond Basic CPQ: Why Subskribe's Advanced Pricing Engine is Transforming Enterprise SaaS | Subskribe](https://www.subskribe.com/blog/beyond-basic-cpq-why-subskribes-advanced-pricing-engine-is-transforming-enterprise-saas#:~:text=across%20your%20tech%20stack))) is important in SaaS and something that can be made easier with thoughtful design. An innovator who can confidently say “we support any pricing model you can come up with, and changing it is as easy as a few clicks” will address a major unmet need.

- **Seamless Quote-to-Cash Integration:** A big opportunity is to either **extend CPQ into adjacent spaces** or partner tightly for a unified solution. One path is what some startups do: combine CPQ, billing, and maybe even revenue recognition into one platform (essentially an all-in-one revenue platform). This is ambitious but tackles the integration headaches head-on – it means one consistent system from quote through cash collection. For a new entrant, building all that is a lot, but focusing on a solid CPQ with exceptional integration capabilities might be more feasible. This could involve providing pre-built connectors to popular SaaS tools (Salesforce, HubSpot, Netsuite, Stripe, Zuora, Xero, etc.) and ensuring that those integrations are *real-time and bidirectional*. Another aspect is offering an API-first product, so that developers can easily embed the CPQ in other systems or automate data flows. The messaging could be “our CPQ plays nice with everything.” For example, if a SaaS company already loves their billing system, a new CPQ could win by showing a turnkey integration where quotes automatically create subscriptions/invoices in that billing system with 100% accuracy ([CPQ Software for SaaS Businesses: How to Choose the Right One](https://vendori.com/blog/cpq-software-for-saas-businesses-how-to-choose-the-right-one#:~:text=,time%20pricing)). Solving that integration puzzle is a valued innovation – it saves companies from having to build and maintain it themselves. In short, the opportunity is to present a CPQ that **either is the quote-to-cash suite or fits seamlessly into one**.

- **Performance and Scalability Focus:** By leveraging modern cloud infrastructure and perhaps microservices or specialized computation engines, a new CPQ product could distinguish itself by handling large and complex quotes *effortlessly*. This might not seem glamorous, but enterprise buyers care. Publishing benchmarks (e.g. “our CPQ can handle 10,000 line-item quotes in under 2 seconds”) would catch attention. Achieving this might involve creative caching, incremental calculations, or an in-memory pricing engine. The benefit for users is reduced wait times and the ability to quote big deals without fear. Combined with that, ensuring high reliability (uptime, error handling) is important – a CPQ that never “breaks” during a demo or in the field builds trust. Some companies have been burned by CPQ outages or critical bugs halting their sales quoting; an opportunity exists to rebuild trust by being the *“rock-solid”* CPQ provider. This ties into offering great support and transparency as well, turning what was a pain (bugs, slow support response) into a strength.

- **Intelligence and Automation:** With advancements in AI, there’s an opening for CPQ solutions that not only automate what used to be manual, but also provide **predictive or prescriptive insights**. An innovator might integrate AI to analyze historical quote data and suggest optimal pricing or discount levels that increase win probability. Or automatically detect if a quote configuration is unusual compared to successful past deals and warn the rep. Even simpler, using AI to help configure rules (like Logik.io’s AI that writes configuration rules from natural language ([Logik.io Launches Industry-First AI Capabilities for CPQ and Commerce](https://www.logik.io/news/logik-launches-industry-first-ai#:~:text=Logik,AI%20to%20create%20advanced%20rules))) dramatically lowers admin effort. These kinds of features directly target the pain of complexity by *offloading work to the system*. Another idea: a CPQ chatbot for sales reps, where a rep could essentially say, “I need to quote 200 users on Product X with Y add-on, annual billing” and the system prepares the quote in the background. Such an interface could be layered on a robust CPQ engine to make quoting even more accessible (think voice or text-driven quote creation). While these are cutting-edge, the company that does it first (and well) will be seen as a leader in solving CPQ usability in a novel way.

- **Mid-Market and SMB Accessibility:** There’s a segment of the SaaS market (smaller and mid-size companies) that is currently under-served by CPQ because the existing products are enterprise-priced and oriented. Innovators can tailor offerings to this group – perhaps a lighter-weight CPQ with modular upgrades. This could mean a frictionless SaaS trial, easy self-service setup, and pricing that scales with usage (so a startup can afford it at a few hundred dollars a month, and it grows as they grow). By capturing companies early, a new CPQ can become embedded in their process and then grow with them. The opportunity here is to lower the barrier to entry so that even a 50-person SaaS company could say, “Yes, let’s implement CPQ” – something that today might sound outlandish due to cost/effort. Salesbricks, for instance, explicitly markets to startups with the promise of being more approachable than Salesforce CPQ ([5 Best CPQ Software for SaaS Startups (+ When to Invest)](https://www.salesbricks.com/blog/best-cpq-for-saas-startups#:~:text=While%20it%20is%20a%20powerful,too%20complicated%20for%20young%20startups)). This strategy not only opens a bigger market, but also fosters loyalty as those companies scale up.

In conclusion, there is ample room to innovate in the CPQ space. The **holy grail** is a CPQ solution that combines the depth and robustness of legacy platforms (to handle complex scenarios) with the ease-of-use and agility of modern software. The SaaS industry, with its dynamic pricing and fast pace, is an ideal proving ground for such a solution. A product that genuinely addresses the major pain points – complexity, poor UX, integration gaps, rigidity – would not only win over frustrated customers of existing tools but could also expand CPQ adoption to businesses that previously shied away from it. The continued complaints about current CPQ offerings ([No one is happy after implementing CPQ (except the consulting company and CPQ company itself) : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/7vcc4p/no_one_is_happy_after_implementing_cpq_except_the/#:~:text=1,manage%2Fmaintain)) ([CPQ users out there, what are you using and are you happy with it? : r/salesforce](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/b7spxc/cpq_users_out_there_what_are_you_using_and_are/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)) are essentially the market signaling that *“we need something better.”* Whoever delivers that better solution stands to transform the quote-to-cash process from a notorious headache into a competitive advantage for businesses.

## Conclusion 
CPQ software plays a mission-critical role in the SaaS industry’s revenue operations, but our deep-dive shows that it remains a domain rife with challenges. Established CPQ vendors like Salesforce, Oracle, and Conga have brought structured quoting to many companies, yet users frequently encounter complexity, high costs, and subpar user experiences in these tools. The result is that many businesses still struggle with inefficiencies and frustrations in their quote-to-cash journey – indicating that CPQ is a problem only *partially* solved by current solutions. 

From a business perspective, the promise of streamlined sales and error-free quotes is too often undermined by lengthy implementations, difficult maintenance, and siloed systems that don’t fully talk to each other. From a user perspective, sales teams often feel hindered rather than helped, due to clunky interfaces or rigid processes. The **core issue** is that selling complex SaaS products *is* a complicated endeavor – but the tools to manage that complexity have historically added their own burdens. This tension leaves an opening for improved approaches.

The CPQ ecosystem is now at an inflection point. We see a new generation of startups and niche players pushing boundaries to make CPQ faster, smarter, and more aligned with modern SaaS business models. Whether it’s through no-code flexibility, AI-driven automation, or unified platforms, these innovations aim to resolve long-standing pain points. The market is essentially asking for CPQ solutions that *empower* businesses – enabling them to configure and quote creatively and efficiently – rather than constrain them. 

For someone looking to innovate in this space, the path is clear: learn from the pain points of the past and build a CPQ experience that delivers **simplicity without sacrificing sophistication**. The reward is a significant one. Every SaaS company that has felt the pain of a clunky CPQ or an overly manual process is a potential champion for a better way. A truly effective CPQ solution can unlock faster deal cycles, higher win rates, and smoother revenue operations – outcomes that directly translate to competitive advantage in the SaaS industry. In that sense, solving CPQ is not just a technical feat, but a catalyst for business growth. The problem may be hard, but it is certainly worth solving, and the opportunity to do so has never been greater.
